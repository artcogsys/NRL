Neural Reinforcement Learning Framework

This framework can be used to teach neural networks to solve cognitive tasks. It also provides functionality to interpret
the trained models and link them to observational data.

Core functionality is provided by:
* Tasks: Implementation of various cognitive tasks
* Agents: Implementation of agents that use particular reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
* Modelzoo: Implemenentation of custom layers and recurrent neural networks; the 'brains' of our RL agents
* Analysis: Provides functionality for model analysis and visualization
